Since the @platform is fully open sourced and everyone can contribute, there is no cost for developers! When you make an app on the @platform, people that use your apps will not have to pay any fees for infrastructure or storage! The way that **AtSign** generates revenue is by using our special identifier which is known as an @sign. An @sign can come in many flavors with corresponding prices ranging from free, $10, $100, $1000, $5000. If you opt-in for the vanity @sign the prices increase as the @sign of your liking decreases in length and complexity. For each paid @sign you own, there is a $10 annual renewal fee. This fee does not apply to the free @signs. What makes @signs so awesome is that if your app is the first one someone pairs an @sign with, after buying their @sign, we pay you commission on that. Yep, you don't pay us, we pay you.  
## Paid @signs
For paid @signs the options are listed below:

1. **For $10**: A *Hybrid* @sign is an sign that ends with an underscore and up to four numbers:  
    - ```atsignexample_01```  
    <br />
2. **For $100**: A *Custom* @sign is an sign that is any combination of words, numbers, or even emojis! (at least five characters, or four characters if it includes a number or emoji):
    - ```atsignexample```
    - ```atest```
    - ```tes5```  
    <br />
3. **For $1000**: A *Custom* @sign that is only three or four characters (no numbers):
    - ```test```
    - ```four```
    - ```tes```
    - ```dog```    
    <br />
4. **For $5000**: A *Custom* @sign that is only three characters:
    - ```007```
    - ```te5```
    - ```r4n```  <br />  

## Free @signs

For a FREE @sign there exists an @sign generator which creates a new set of @signs at random for you to choose from! You are given two options: the first option requires you to add some pre-generated @signs while the second option lets you generate an @sign based on your interests using *super-secret* mode. Let's say you like music and sports, the @sign generator would perform its magic and dish out:
