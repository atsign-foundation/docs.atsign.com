Our Dart/Flutter SDK takes full advantage of the atProtocol and implements all the necessary features like encryption key generation, cram & pkam authentication, verb building, end-to-end encrypted data sharing, encrypting self data, and much more.

## What's Covered

This is where you can quickly learn and update yourself on various atPlatform concepts.

If you haven't already, we recommend you head to [Get Started Flutter Development](docs/start/flutter/) first.

The following is covered in this codelab:

- **AtClientManager** - an object with various services such as Client, NotificationService, and SyncService.
- **AtClientPreference** - object used to configure preferences in your atPlatform application such as the namespace, storage path for the hive database, or maximum data size.
- **Onboarding** - process of activating an atSign and/or authenticating the atsign into its secondary server.
- **Key Basics** - learn how keys are stored in the secondary server and what key metadata is.
