## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1. Get an editor for programming in Dart

Some editors we recommend:
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>
- <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">Android Studio</a>

### 2. Install Flutter/Dart on your machine

See Flutter's instructions on getting the Flutter environment setup:
- <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos" target="_blank">MacOS</a>
- <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows" target="_blank">Windows</a>
- <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux" target="_blank">Linux</a>


### 3. Install at_app

<a href="https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_app" target="_blank">at_app</a> is a command-line tool for quickly creating atPlatform apps. It is similar to `flutter create` but adds atPlatform capabilities to your flutter apps. See our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ciusz9mPpVY" target="_blank">video</a> on at_app.

#### 4. Create an atPlatform app

Create an atPlatform app by using <a href="https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_app" target="_blank">at_app</a>
1. `at_app create <dir>`
2. `cd <dir>`
3. `flutter run`
