  Get started with IoT (Internet of Things) devices on the atPlatform. The Internet of things describes physical objects with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.
  In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems, cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. IoT is also used in healthcare systems.
  The atPlatform strips things down to the protocol level, creating both zero trust and zero configuration environments–completely without passwords–eliminating all attack surfaces created by over-complexity, and simplifying the administration of devices in the process.

## What is IoT?

IoT–Internet of Things–is a system of interconnecting devices, mechanical or electronic, that are designed to work together to provide a service, such as the transmission of information, or the control of a device.

In simple terms, an IoT device is any device (such as a camera, a smart phone, a thermostat, a TV, a computer, etc) that is connected to the internet. IoT devices have sensors that are always collecting data and sending it through the Internet. However, these data are usually precious data that are valuable to the owner. For example, a person may own a camera connected to the internet which is constantly surveilling the living room of their house. It is important that outside parties have no access to this data and that the data the camera is collecting is sent securely over the internet. This is where the atPlatform comes in. The atPlatform adds security to this IoT camera device and sends the data securely to whomever the owner chooses.

As said on our [website](https://atsign.com/iot-internet-of-things/#overview), the atPlatform strips things down to the protocol level, creating both zero trust and zero configuration environments–completely without passwords–eliminating all attack surfaces created by over-complexity, and simplifying the administration of devices in the process.
