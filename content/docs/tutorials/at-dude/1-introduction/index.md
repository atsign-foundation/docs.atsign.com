In this tutorial we will build the atDude app. This app is a secure, end-to-end encrypted, peer-to-peer application that allows you to send 'dudes' to your contacts!

The longer you press and hold the Dude button, the longer your sent dude will be! You can keep up-to-date with your 'dude' stats to see how much duding you've done!

This app is built on the atPlatform. The atPlatform is an open-source backend platform that allows developers to build end-to-end encrypted applications.

The purpose of this tutorial is to guide you through the steps in creating a production-ready app on the atPlatform.
