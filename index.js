IoT devices have sensors that are always collecting data and sending it through the Internet. However, these data are usually precious data that are valuable to the owner. For example, a person may own a camera connected to the internet which is constantly surveilling the living room of their house. It is important that outside parties have no access to this data and that the data the camera is collecting is sent securely over the internet. This is where the atPlatform comes in. The atPlatform adds security to this IoT camera device and sends the data securely to whomever the owner chooses.\nAs said on our website atsign.com, the atPlatform strips things down to the protocol level, creating both zero trust and zero configuration environments–completely without passwords–eliminating all attack surfaces created by over-complexity, and simplifying the administration of devices in the process.\nIoT Network Architecture #\rSsh! No Ports #\rSsh! No ports is a perfect demonstration of how the atPlatform is adding end-to-end security to your IoT devices.\nWant to ssh to your remote (IoT or non-IoT) device without it having any open ports?\nSee our Ssh! No Ports tutorial:\nSsh! No Ports \u0026rarr;    Contact us #\rHere at Atsign, we believe in a world where IoT devices have atSigns and send their data end-to-end-encrypted to other atSigns.

        content: "Introduction #\rThe atProtocol is the underlying protocol that the atPlatform implements. It is a simple internet protocol for interacting with the Root Server and Secondary Server. The atPlatform builds on top of the atProtocol by taking full advantage of the features of the atProtocol.\nSee our Protocol Specification on our GitHub page under our at_protocol repository.\nIf you see a typo, mistake, or want to suggest a feature, please see our contributing guidelines. All contributions are welcome.\nRoot Server #\rA Root Server should provide a lookup of where a Secondary Server for an atSign is running. This is similar to a DNS server.\nWhen asking a Root Server for the lookup of a particular atSign the Root Server should respond with a null if the name does not exist and if the name exists the DNS name or address of the atServer and the IP port number for that atSign should be returned.\nResponse:\n\u0026lt;host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;\nThe Root Server only has one verb - @exit and all other inputs are considered to be lookup requests.\nSecondary Server #\rA Secondary Server is where an atSign user\u0026rsquo;s personal data should be stored. One interacts with a secondary using the verbs exposed by the protocol.\nA Secondary Server should have 4 major sub components:\n Key Store Commit Log Access Log Notification Log  Verbs described in the document should be used to create, update, delete and retrieve information from the above sub components.\n1. Key Store #\rKey store is a place where user data in a Secondary Server should be saved as key and value pairs. Apart from the value, an atSign user should be able to add certain metadata for a key.\nKey #\rA key in the atProtocol can be formed by using any alphanumeric and special characters (UTF-8) excluding \u0026ldquo;@\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;:\u0026rdquo; and a white space (\u0026quot; \u0026ldquo;). A key in a secondary can be any of the following 5 types:\n Public Key   A public key is a key which can be looked up by any atSign user. A public key should be part of the scan verb result. Format of the public key should be public::\u0026lt;@sign\u0026gt;.  Example:\npublic:location@alice\n The owner of the secondary should be allowed to update or delete the value of a public key.\n Private Key   A private key is a key which cannot be looked up by any atSign user other than the one who created it. A private key should not be returned in a scan verb result. Format of the private key should be privatekey::\u0026lt;@sign\u0026gt;.  Example:\nprivatekey:pk1@alice\n The owner of the secondary should be allowed to update or delete the value of a private key.\n User key   A user key can only be looked up by an atSign user with whom the data has been shared. A user key should be part of the scan verb result only for the user who created it and the specific user it has been shared with. Format of the key shared with someone else should be \u0026lt;Shared with atSign\u0026gt;::\u0026lt;Created by atSign\u0026gt;.  Example:\n@bob:phone@alice\n Note: Above Key should be part of scan verb result only for @alice and @bob\n  The owner of the secondary should be allowed to update or delete the value of a user key.\n Internal Key   Internal keys start with an underscore(_) and are not displayed in scan results. Internal keys can be looked up only by the owner of the secondary  Cached Key   A cached key is a key that was originally created by another atSign user but is now cached on the Secondary Server of another user\u0026rsquo;s atSign as they were given permission to cache it. A cached key should be listed in the scan verb result for the atSign user who cached it. Format of the key shared with someone else should be cached:\u0026lt;Shared with atSign\u0026gt;::\u0026lt;Created by atSign\u0026gt;.  Example:\ncached:@bob:phone@alice\n The user who has cached the key should not be allowed to update the cached key.\n  An atSign user who has created and shared the key should be allowed to update a cached key, and if the \u0026ldquo;autoNotify\u0026rdquo; config parameter is set to true, the updated value should be notified (please refer to the notify verb) and the cached key updated with the new value.\n  If the user who originally shared the keys set the CCD (Cascade delete) to true, the cached key will be deleted when the original key is deleted.\n Value #\rText or binary values can be saved in a Secondary Server. The size of the valuue saved in a secondary is bound by the config parameter \u0026ldquo;maxBufferSize\u0026rdquo;.\n A user should be made aware of this limitation by using the stats verb.\n  If a binary value is being saved on a Secondary Server, the \u0026ldquo;isBinary\u0026rdquo; attribute on the metadata should be set to true by the convention.\n  Reference Value  A Secondary Server should support referencing another key\u0026rsquo;s value.\nA reference value should be in the format \u0026ldquo;atsign://\u0026rdquo;.\nFor example, \u0026lsquo;phone@bob(key)\u0026rsquo; is 1234 (value). Now another key called altPhone@bob can refer to phone@bob by referencing it as altPhone@bob == atsign://phone@bob.\nWhen the user does a lookup on the key that contains a reference, the Secondary Server should return a fully resolved value.\nMetadata  Metadata of a key should describe the following properties of the value being inserted.\n   Meta Attribute Auto create? Description     createdOn Yes Date and time when the key has been created.   createdBy Yes atSign that has created the key   updatedOn Yes Date and tiem when the key has been last updated   sharedWith No atSign of the user with whom the key has been shared. Can be null if not shared with anyone.   ttl No Time to live in milliseconds.   expiresOn Yes A Date and Time derived from the ttl (now + ttl). A Key should be auto deleted once it expires.   ttb No Time to birth in milliseconds.   availableFrom Yes A Date and Time derived from the ttl (now + ttl). A Key should be only available after availableFrom   isCached No True if the key is cached   ttr No Time in milliseconds after which the cached key needs to be refreshed. Ttr of -1 indicates that the key can be cached forever.   refreshAt No A Date and Time derived from the ttr. The time at which the key gets refreshed.   ccd No Indicates if a cached key needs to be deleted when the atSign user who has originally shared it deletes it.   isBinary No True if the value is a binary value.   isEncrypted No True if the value is encrypted.    2. Commit Log #\rA Secondary Server should record any create, update and delete operations in a commit log. The Commit Log should record these operations with a unique commit id so that users of the secondary can lookup operations that happened on or after a given commit id.\nA Secondary Server should provide a way to compact the Commit Log based on time and size.\n3. Access Log #\rA Secondary Server should record the following user actions: user login, user authentication and lookup. The Access Log should record these operations so that users of the secondary can retrieve various statistics such as the most visited atSign or most visited keys.\nA Secondary Server should provide a way to compact the Access Log based on time and size.\n4. Notification Log #\rA Secondary Server should record any notifications that have been received and sent. Please check the notify verb specification for details on how a notification should be sent.\nA Secondary Server should provide a way to compact the Notification Log based on time and size.\nStandard Keys #\rA Secondary Server should have the following standard keys:\n   Key Description     public:publickey@ Public key used by other atSigns for encryption   public:signing_publickey@ Public key used on a pol handler to a verify a signed challenge   @signing_privatekey@ Private key used to sign a challenge on a pol request   :shared_key@ Symmetric key used to encrypt/decrypt self atSign data    Configuration Parameters #\rA Secondary Server should honor the following configuration parameters.\n   Key Valid Values Description     autoNotify true/false If set to true, a Secondary Server should automatically notify another atSign user when a key has been shared with them. Please refer to the notify verb spec for details.   bufferLimit Number of bytes Maximum size of a value for a key that can be transferred to a Secondary Server   inbound_max_limit An Integer Maximum number of inbound connections that a Secondary Server can accept   outbound_max_limit An Integer Maximum number of outbound connections that a secondary can make to another Secondary Server   inbound_idle_time_millis Time in milliseconds Maximum time the inbound connection can active   outbound_idle_time_millis Time in milliseconds Maximum time the outbound connection can be active.    Block List #\rA user of the Secondary Server should be able to decide who is allowed to connect to a Secondary Server. The config verb should be used to configure this. Once added, a Secondary Server should honor the list at the time of accepting new connections from an atSign user using the from verb.\nVerbs #\rThe from verb #\rSynopsis:\nThe from verb is used to tell a secondary whom you claim to be.\nFollowing regex represents the syntax of the from verb:\nr'^from:(?\u0026lt;@sign\u0026gt;@?[^@\\s]+$)'\nExample:\nfrom:@bob\nResponse:\nIf the user who is trying to connect is the owner of the Secondary Server, then the from verb should respond with the following response.\nkey:\u0026lt;sessionId@sign:uuid\u0026gt;\nIf the user who is trying to connect is not the owner of the Secondary Server, then the from verb should respond with the following response.\nproof:\u0026lt;sessionId\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;@sign\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;UUID\u0026gt;\nIf the user is not allowed to connect to the Secondary Server, then it should respond back with the following error and close the connection to the server.\nerror:AT0013-Connection Exception\nDescription:\nThe from verb is used to tell the Secondary Server what atSign you claim to be. With the from verb, one can connect to one\u0026rsquo;s own Secondary Server or someone else\u0026rsquo;s Secondary Server. In both cases, the Secondary Server responds back with a challenge to prove that you are who you claim to be. This is part of the authentication mechanism of the atProtocol.\nThis authentication mechanism varies based on whether you are connecting to your own secondary (cram) or someone else\u0026rsquo;s secondary (pol).\nOptions:\n\u0026lt;atSign\u0026gt; Required: Yes. atSign with which you are connecting to a Secondary Server\nThe cram verb #\rSynopsis:\nThe cram verb is used to bootstrap authenticate one\u0026rsquo;s own self as the owner of a Secondary Server. It is intended to be used once until a set of PKI keys are cut on the owner\u0026rsquo;s mobile device and from then on we use the pkam verb.\nThe following regex represents the syntax of the cram verb:\nr'^cram:(?\u0026lt;digest\u0026gt;.+$)'\nExample:\ncram:\u0026lt;digest\u0026gt;\nResponse:\nIf the user gets the challenge right, the prompt should change to the atSign of the user.\n\u0026lt;@sign\u0026gt;@\nIf the user gets the cram authentication wrong, then it should respond back with the following error and close the connection to the server.\nerror:AT0401-Client authentication failed\nDescription:\nThe cram verb follows the from verb. As an owner of the Secondary Server, you should be able to take the challenge thrown by the from verb and encrypt using the shared key that the server has been bound with. Upon receiving the cram verb along with the digest, the server decrypts the digest using the shared key and matches it with the challenge. If they are the same, then the secondary lets you connect to the Secondary Server and changes the prompt to your atSign.\nOptions:\n\u0026lt;digest\u0026gt; Required: Yes. Description: Encrypted challenge\nThe pol verb #\rSynopsis:\nThe pol verb is part of the pkam process to authenticate oneself while connecting to someone else\u0026rsquo;s Secondary Server. The term \u0026lsquo;pol\u0026rsquo; means \u0026lsquo;proof of life\u0026rsquo; as it provides a near realtime assurance that the requestor is who it claims to be.\nFollowing regex represents the syntax of the pol verb:\nr'^pol$'\nExample:\npol\nResponse::\nIf the user gets the challenge right the prompt should change to the atSign of the user.\n\u0026lt;@sign\u0026gt;@\nIf the user gets the cram authentication wrong, then it should respond back with the following error and close the connection to the server.\nerror:AT0401-Client authentication failed\nDescription:\nThe pol verb follows the from verb. \u0026lsquo;pol\u0026rsquo; indicates another secondary that the user who is trying to connect is ready to authenticate himself. For example, if @bob is trying to connect to @alice, @bob would take the key and value from the proof response of the verb and create a public key and value which then can be looked up by @alice. After @alice looks up @bob\u0026rsquo;s secondary @alice\u0026rsquo;s secondary should change the prompt to @bob.\nOptions:\nNA\nThe scan verb #\rSynopsis:\nThe scan verb is used to see the keys in an atSign\u0026rsquo;s secondary server.

It uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that your data is 100% owned and controlled by you.\nAn atSign has two states: deactivated and activated. To activate an atSign, CRAM authenticate into your secondary server. After successful CRAM authentication, your atSign is activated where a PKAM key pair is generated by your device and the CRAM key will be invalid; so that only you own the keys to your secondary server.\nEach atSign has a unique key that is used to verify whether you are the atSign’s rightful owner. After first activating an atSign, be sure to save its corresponding key in a secure location. You’ll need it to sign back into the app or use other apps on the atPlatform.\nExample #\rAlice has created their own atSign called @alice. Anyone who looks up @alice can only view the information that they’ve made public through @wavi, an app that lets them set up and customize their public profile. They’ll have the freedom to adjust it as needed, and those changes will be viewable in a matter of seconds.\nWhat you can do with an atSign #\rAt the moment, you can pair your atSign with any app on the atPlatform (the underlying technology behind atSigns) to enable the app to access, but not store, your data. The number of things you can do with your atSign will increase as more and more of these atApps are built.\nWhile we wait for the rest of the Internet to catch up, you can get ahead of the game by downloading the first batch of recently launched atApps. These include @atmospherePro, an end-to-end encrypted file sharing app, @buzz, an entirely new and private way to connect with others, and more.\nDiscover these atApps here.\n"

The goal of encryption is that assuming that an unwanted third party is eavesdropping on an insecure channel, said person would not be able to comprehend the transmitted information. Decryption is the process of converted encrypted information into a comprehensible format. Encryption and Decryption algorithms are known as ciphers. Encryption uses a key which is a set of values that the cipher, as an algorithm, will operate on. Encryption and Decryption go back a long way with one of the most well known ciphers being the Caesar Cipher\nVideo #\rHate reading? Watch this video instead!\n  atPlatform #\rThe atPlatform implements end-to-end encryption that is best illustrated with the following example: @alice wishes to share her phone number with her friend @bob. To do this, @alice, who is on her own device, prompts her own secondary server to direct phone @alice at her friend @bob\u0026rsquo;s secondary server. From here, a shared key is generated for @bob (@bob:shared_key@alice).\nThis shared key uses the same encryption process as the Symmetric Key Encryption, which is called AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and involves three block ciphers: AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256.\nThe atProtocol specifically uses AES-256 for Data Encryption Keys.\nThe RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption algorithm is then used to encrypt the shared key from the above example with @bob\u0026rsquo;s public key. The atProtocol specifically utilizes RSA 2048. Note, that because the RSA algorithm is an Asymmetric Key Encryption method, a public and private key are generated.\nIf you want to read more about Encryption and how it works on the atPlatform check this Medium article!\nRelated Resources #\rPublic and Private Keys \u0026rarr;    Self-Encryption Key \u0026rarr;    Privacy \u0026rarr;    "

This is true for both sides, you may ask for data from different sources and get a different answer for each one.\nPolymorphic Data #\rThe @buzz app is a stellar example of polymorphic data on the atPlatform. @buzz is like your contacts application, but with a twist. Rather than manually entering details for all of your contacts, and having to deal with duplicate contact entries from trying to sync all of your contacts over the cloud, you simply connect with someone through their atSign. In @buzz, they can create and share a specific persona with you. For example, I might want to share my work phone and email with colleagues, but my phone and a different email with friends. I can set up separate “work” and “friends” personas with each set of information, so when I connect with someone new, all I have to do is share the correct persona with that person. Better yet, if I want to share multiple personas, I can do that too! If I move or change my email address, I can update my information in the app, and my contacts have access to the new information and don’t have to make any edits themselves.\nExample #\r@alice’s work persona may have a different value for email than her persona.

        content: "Definition #\rA private key is used in asymmetric key cryptography. Asymmetric key cryptography is based on applying mathematical functions to numbers to achieve personal secrecy. It uses two keys, one being the private key. If you think of decryption as locking and unlocking padlocks with keys, then the padlock that is locked with a public key can only be unlocked with its corresponding private key.\nOn the other hand, public keys are distributed to the trusted masses. This is done through a public-key distribution channel. This channel should provide authentication and integrity. Someone should not send their public key to the community pretending to have a different public key. Everyone should have their own private and public keys. For example, Bob only needs one private key to receive all correspondence in the community, but Alice needs n public keys to communicate with n entities in the community, one public key for each entity. In other words, Alice needs a ring of public keys.\nHow it works at Atsign #\rA key in the atProtocol can be formed by using any alphanumeric and special characters (UTF-8) excluding \u0026ldquo;@\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;:\u0026rdquo; and a white space (\u0026quot; \u0026ldquo;). A key in a secondary can be any of the following 5 types:\n  Public Key\n  A public key is a key which can be looked up by any atSign holder.\n  A public key should be part of the scan verb result.\n  Format of the public key should be public:\u0026lt;identifier\u0026gt;:\n  Example:\npublic:location@alice\n The owner of the secondary should be allowed to update or delete the value of a public key.\n   Self Key\n  A Self key is a key which cannot be looked up any atSign holder other than the one created it.\n  A Self key should not be returned in a scan verb result.\n  Format of the Self key should be privatekey:\u0026lt;identifier\u0026gt;:\n  Example:\nprivatekey:pk1@alice\n The owner of the secondary should be allowed to update or delete the value of a private key.\n   Shared key\n A shared key can only be looked up by an atSign holder with whom the data has been shared. A shared key should be part of the scan verb result only for the person who created it and the specific person it has been shared with. Format of the key shared with someone else should be\ncached::\u0026lt;identifier\u0026gt;:  Example:\n@bob:phone@alice\n Note: Above Key should be part of scan verb result for only @alice and @bob\n  The owner of the secondary should be allowed to update or delete the value of a user key.\n More context on shared keys: We know that Atsign uses AES-256 \u0026amp; RSA-2048 for symmetric and asymmetric encryption respectfully.\n  RSA-2048 can encrypt up to 214 bytes which does not constitute for a lot of data. However, because it is asymmetric, we can use it to ensure that you are you by verifying that you have your private key.\n  AES-256 can encrypt around a whopping 250 million terabytes which is practically unlimited. The downside is that because this is a symmetric key, we cannot use it to authorize that you are you since this is shared with the recipient.\n  To remediate this, I can generate an AES(shared) key, and encrypt it using your public RSA key. Then we can decrypt said AES key using your private RSA key. Since you are the only holder of your private key, I can ensure that only the two of us hold the AES key. Now we can share information back-and-forth safely using the AES key as a means of encryption/decryption.\n  Private Key\n Private keys start with an underscore(_) and are not displayed in scan results. Private keys can only be looked up by the owner of the secondary    Cached Key\n  A cached key is a key that was originally created by another atSign owner but is now cached on the Secondary Server of another person\u0026rsquo;s atSign as they were given permission to cache it.\n  A cached key should be listed in the scan verb result for the atSign owner who cached it.\n  Format of the key shared with someone else should be\ncached::\u0026lt;identifier\u0026gt;:\n  Example:\ncached:@bob:phone@alice\n The person who has cached the key should not be allowed to update the cached key.\n  An atSign owner who has created and shared the key should be allowed to update a cached key, and if the \u0026ldquo;autoNotify\u0026rdquo; config parameters is set to true, the updated value should be notified (please refer to the notify verb) and the cached key updated with the new value.\n  If the person who originally shared the keys set the CCD (Cascade delete) to true, the cached key will be deleted when the original key is deleted.\n   "

Once authenticated, you may add, update, delete, and lookup keys in your own secondary server.\nWhen users get their atSign from atsign.com, they receive their CRAM secret in the form of a QR code. A CRAM secret is just a long string of randomly generated characters. The CRAM secret can also be fetched from a REST API since sometimes the QR code can be cumbersome. It is recommended that you let the SDK handle these API requests as it is easier and safer.\nCRAM is made easy with the atPlatform. Since the CRAM secret was generated and given by Atsign, that would be like Atsign generating your password for you. To opposite this, atPlatform\u0026rsquo;s SDKs and authentication services (such as at_onboarding_flutter) make it easy to generate a .atKeys file for subsequent logins to your secondary.

        content: "Definition #\rPKAM stands for public key authentication mechanism. It is a mechanism for encrypting/decrypting data between two parties.\natPlatform #\rThe atPlatform\u0026rsquo;s packages and SDKs help apps generate a RSA PKAM public/private keypair and save this in a .atKeys file containing these keys. Since Atsign provided the CRAM secret, this poses an vulnerability since this is a shared secret between you and Atsign. To avert this, a new RSA PKAM keypair is generated on your device and the CRAM secret is no longer valid. The PKAM keypair is used for all subsequent authentications, and as you are the only one with access to the private key, you are the only one who is able to authenticate.\nThe PKAM public key is given out to other clients who want to send data to you. The data they send to you is encrypted using your public key and is decrypted using your private key. Read more on asymmetric encryption here.\nThe PKAM private key used by the client to authenticate into their own secondary server. It is just like the CRAM secret except it was generated by you (as opposed by Atsign) and completely owned by you.\natProtocol #\rIn the atProtocol PKAM is a verb.\nThe pkam verb is used to authenticate one\u0026rsquo;s own self as an owner of a Secondary Server using a PKI style authentication.\nThe following regex represents the syntax of the pkam verb: ^pkam:(?\u0026lt;signature\u0026gt;.+$)\nLearn more about the pkam verb here.\nKey Definitions #\r PKAM: public key authentication mechanism PKI: public key infrastructure RSA: \u0026ldquo;Rivest-Shamir-Aldeman\u0026rdquo; is an assymetric encryption algorithm.

        content: "Definition #\rAtsign\u0026rsquo;s CTO, Colin Constable says this in an interview on Namespaces: \u0026ldquo;Most people are familiar with DNS (domain name system): for example, if you type “cnn.com”, “fox.com”, or “bbc.com”, you get news sites. But you can’t just type in “news” and expect the Internet to tell you which particular flavor of news you want. We need to create namespaces so that humans can remember the name and computers can translate it to Internet protocol. Once there is a namespace like “bbc.com,” you can reliably know that somebody owns that particular space, and it needs to be managed so that there are no clashes. For instance, you don’t want to type “bbc.com” and get sent to Amazon’s home page. That’s why they have to be unique, and we at Atsign created a new namespace with @Namespace.\u0026rdquo;\nFeel free to read more on namespaces here.\natPlatform #\rNamespace is a common term that may occur when reading about the atPlatform. To put it simply, a namespace is a unique container to place data in. More in the context of the apps, namespaces are just atSigns associated with each app so a secondary server can be aware of which data belongs to who. See an example below.\nExample #\rWhen you ask someone “What is my name?” you will get a different answer for every person you ask. If you ask your parents, they may answer with a sweet nickname they gave you. If you ask your friends, they may answer with your first name. This is how namespaces work. You can ask different namespaces for data and get a different answer every time.\nIn the context of the atProtocol, refer to the example below to improve your understanding.\nExample:\n phone.mospherepro (phone is the key, mospherepro is the namespace) will answer with data=123-123-1234 phone.alice (phone is the key, alice is the namespace) will answer with data=444-444-4444 phone.wavi (phone is the key, wavi is the namespace) will answer with data=555-555-5555  This is the beauty of the atProtocol. Each namespace replied with different information. People control their own data and which applications get what data. With the atPlatform, the people become in control of their own data privacy.\nRelated Resources #\rProtocol Specification \u0026rarr;    Secondary Server \u0026rarr;    Polymorphism \u0026rarr;    "

        content: "Definition #\rWith atProtocol, your data is encrypted with your self encryption key and stored on your device. Periodically, this data is copied securely over to a dedicated cloud server which only you can decrypt and read since you are the only one who owns the private key. No one else, including Atsign can read your data. This process is known as synchronization.\natPlatform #\rFirst, we need to touch up on what local \u0026amp; remote secondaries are:\n Remote Secondary: A microservice with a DNS address that makes it addressable, provides a backup of your data in case of loss on the phone, and provides a joining place to synchronize data if you have more than one device. Local Secondary: A copy of data that allows for fast interactivity and offline support. Every activated atSign gets its remote secondary which runs on Atsign\u0026rsquo;s servers. All of your data is signed and encrypted, so Atsign cannot see it.  Synchronization aims to keep both local and remote secondaries with the same data. If by any chance the device is lost, then the data can be retrieved from the remote secondary:\nTwo main scenarios require synchronization. The first occurs when your device is offline. Updates are saved to your device but not synced to the server. Once the device goes online, those saved updates get synced to the server. The second scenario is when you have multiple devices: one device is offline while the other is online. Updates from the online device will get synced to the server periodically. However, the offline device will not be able to pull the changes until it is back online.\nTo read more about synchronization and how it works check out this Medium Article we made.\nRelated Resources #\rRoot Server \u0026rarr;    Secondary Server \u0026rarr;    "

The atPlatform provides people, entities, and things with unique identifiers called atSigns.\nEach atSign creates its own public and private cryptographic key pair. The private keys are kept private and public keys made available globally through the atProtocol.\nThe atProtocol provides verbs for interacting with fully qualified atSigns and the data in their secondary servers.\nRoot Secondary #\rWhen asking a Root Server for the lookup of a particular atSign the Root Server should respond with a null if the name does not exist and if the name exists the DNS name or address of the @server and the IP port number for that @sign should be returned. The Root Server is the only centralized feature controlled by Atsign.\nSecondary Servers #\rSecondary servers are servers that belong to an atSign and hold data. All of the data in the secondary server is encrypted unless the owner specifically wants to make some data publicly available.\nWhat is at_java? #\rat_java is Atsign’s implementation of the atProtocol. Just like Atsign’s dart libraries, at_java allows you to interact with Atsign’s services like registering atSigns, onboarding, communicating with the root \u0026amp; secondary servers, and more.\nWhere can at_java be used? #\rAs long as the device running at_java has\n Internet Java 8 or higher  Then at_java can be used to add simplicity and security to your Java applications and/or IoT devices running Java.\nat_java is perfect for those who want to interact with low-level atProtocol for whatever the use case is. Whether it be IoT devices sending end-to-end-encrypted data, sharing medical data between patients, or storing data in your Java apps that you can feel safe about owning; the possibilities are endless with the power of the atProtocol.\nAs of writing this (July 20, 2022), at_java only has remote secondary implementation meaning that the device running this service must be connected to the internet.\n"

They are:\n put putMeta  put\nUpdate’s value of key is if it is already present. Otherwise creates a new key.\nTo share a key to another atSign, use AtKey.shared() factory method or populate AtKey.sharedWith with the atSign to whom the data has to be shared. Further, notifies the sharedWith atSign that a key has been created.\nSignature\nFuture\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; put(AtKey key, dynamic value);\nAccepts an instance of AtKey and value and stores it in the local storage(local secondary) has a key-value pair.\nAtKey represents the key against which the value will be stored. It further describes to whom the data is shared and metadata of the key. key rules\nThe value can be either a textual information or a binary data (e.g. Images, Files etc ). Returns a boolean value that represents the status of the put method. Returns ‘TRUE’ when put is completed successfully, else returns false.\nThrows AtClientException with an error code and error description that describes that cause of the exception.\nputMeta\nUpdates the metadata of the key.\nSignature\nFuture\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; putMeta(AtKey key);\nAccepts an Instance of AtKey. The Metadata is encapsulated in the AtKey. Set the new/updated metadata to [Atkey.Metadata].\nReturns a boolean value that represents the status of the putMeta method. Returns ‘TRUE’ when putMeta is completed successfully, else returns false.\nThrows AtClientException with an error code and error description that describes that cause of the exception.\nRead Data\nget\nGet the value of the key from the user\u0026rsquo;s cloud secondary. Signature Future\u0026lt;AtValue\u0026gt; get (AtKey key);\nAccepts an Instance of AtKey. The Metadata is encapsulated in the AtKey. Fetch both the value and metadata of the key.\nReturns a boolean value that represents the status of the ‘get’ method. Returns ‘TRUE’ when ‘get’ is completed successfully, else returns false.\nThrows AtClientException with an error code and error description that describes that cause of the exception.\ngetMeta\nGets the metadata of the key.\nSignature\nFuture \u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; getMeta(AtKey key);\nAccepts an Instance of AtKey.

Returns ‘TRUE’ when getMeta is completed successfully, else returns false.\nThrows AtClientException with an error code and error description that describes that cause of the exception.\nDelete Data\nDeletes the key.\nSignature Future\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; delete(AtKey key);\nAccepts an Instance of AtKey. Deletes the key from the storage. If the key is shared with another atSign, notifies the other atSign on the deletion of the key.\nReturns a boolean value that represents the status of the delete method. Returns ‘TRUE’ when delete is completed successfully, else returns false.\nThrows AtClientException with an error code and error description that describes that cause of the exception.\nList of Keys\ngetKeys\nGet all the keys stored in the user\u0026rsquo;s secondary in string format.\nSignature\nFuture \u0026lt;\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;\u0026gt; getKeys({String? regex, String? sharedBy, String? sharedWith});\nIf regex is specified only matching keys are returned, giving you the flexibility to use different regexes for different types of data.\ngetAtKeys\nGet all the keys stored in the user\u0026rsquo;s secondary in [AtKey] format.\nSignature\nFuture \u0026lt;\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;AtKey\u0026gt;\u0026gt; getAtKeys({String? regex, String? sharedBy, String? sharedWith});\nIf regex is specified only matching keys are returned, giving you the flexibility to use different regexes for different types of data.\nNotification\natProtocol data visibility\nThe atProtocol saves data created in a key-value pair format. atProtocol lets you create data with three levels of visibility. They are public, shared and self data. In the atProtocol a piece of data is identified as a certain data type based on the key structure. In the SDK, AtKey exposes abstractions to create keys for the various data types. Below sections describe this in detail.\nPublic data\nPublic data can be looked up without authentication. I.e. if @bob wants to lookup public data in the secondary server of @alice, @bob does not need to prove to @alice that he is @bob to see the data publicly shared by @alice. Public view of the @alice’s data will be the same for any user on the atPlatform. I.e. if @jane and @john look up some public data from @alice, it will be exactly the same as what @bob sees.\nGood examples of public data in the real world are “first name” and the “last name”. We often don’t mind sharing our name with people, even random strangers.\nSigning of public data Public data is signed with the “private keys” of the user. Which means when @alice looks up @bob’s public data, @alice knows for sure that the data is indeed from @bob.\nCreating a public key\nvar publicKey = AtKey.public(\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, namespace: \u0026#39;wavi\u0026#39;) .build(); Persisting public data\nfinal atClientManager = await AtClientManager.getInstance() .setCurrentAtSign(‘@alice, \u0026#39;me\u0026#39;, AtClientPreference()); var atClient = atClientManager.atClient; var phoneKey = AtKey.public(\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, namespace: \u0026#39;wavi\u0026#39;) .build();; var value = \u0026#39;+1 100 200 300\u0026#39;; var putResult = await atClient.put(phoneKey, value); Shared data\nShared data does exactly what it says it does! It is created in order to share it with other people. These are the people we typically know and trust. When @bob shares his phone number with @alice, then only @alice can see that piece of data. Good examples of shared data in the real world are “phone number” and “email”. We only share these details with the people we know and trust.\nEncryption of shared data\nWhen @bob shares data to @alice, @bob generates a shared key for @alice and encrypts the data with the shared key. Further, the shared key is encrypted with the @alice public key. So the data shared is cryptographically secure.\nCreating a shared key\nvar sharedKey = AtKey.shared(\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, namespace: \u0026#39;wavi\u0026#39;) ..sharedWith(\u0026#39;@bob\u0026#39;).build(); Persisting shared data\nfinal atClientManager = await AtClientManager.getInstance() .setCurrentAtSign(‘@alice, \u0026#39;me\u0026#39;, AtClientPreference()); var atClient = atClientManager.atClient; var phoneKey = AtKey.shared(\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, namespace: \u0026#39;wavi\u0026#39;) ..sharedWith(\u0026#39;@bob\u0026#39;) .build(); var value = \u0026#39;+1 100 200 300\u0026#39;; var putResult = await atClient.put(phoneKey, value); Self data Self data is created for self. If @bob creates data for self, only @bob and no one else can see the data.\nGood examples of self data are “passwords” and “financial data”. We keep these details to ourselves.\nEncryption of self data\nWhen @bob creates data for self it is encrypted using @bob’s self encryption key.\nCreating a self key\nvar selfKey = AtKey.self(\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, namespace: \u0026#39;wavi\u0026#39;) .build(); Persisting self data\nfinal atClientManager = await AtClientManager.getInstance() .setCurrentAtSign(‘@alice, \u0026#39;me\u0026#39;, AtClientPreference()); var atClient = atClientManager.atClient; var phoneKey = AtKey.self(\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, namespace: \u0026#39;wavi\u0026#39;) .build(); var value = \u0026#39;+1 100 200 300\u0026#39;; var putResult = await atClient.put(phoneKey, value);  All of the above rules are implemented and exposed using the validate() method on AtKey. These rules are enforced during creation of the data.  Key attributes of atProtocol data\nTTL - Time to live\nTTL (Time To Live) is the duration of time for which the key will be available. TTL is expressed in milliseconds. Adding TTL during the key creation results in the time at which the key expires.\n// Below key expires in 1 minute var phoneKey = (AtKey.shared(\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, namespace: \u0026#39;wavi\u0026#39;) ..sharedWith(\u0026#39;bob\u0026#39;) ..timeToLive(60000)) .build(); var value = \u0026#39;+1 100 200 300\u0026#39;; var putResult = await atClient.put(phoneKey, value); Scan/List behavior with TTL A key whose ttl has been set will be listed until a background job that runs at frequent time intervals deletes all the expired keys\nLookup/Get behavior with TTL As long as the key has not expired, a “lookup” of the key returns the value that was set originally. After the key expiry, ‘null’ is returned when the key is looked up for a value.\nTTB - Time to birth\nTTB (Time To Birth) is the span of time within which the key’s value is not available. TTB is expressed in milliseconds. Adding TTB during the key creation results in the time at which the key\u0026rsquo;s value is available.\n// Below key is available after 1 minute var phoneKey = (AtKey.shared(\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, namespace: \u0026#39;wavi\u0026#39;) ..sharedWith(\u0026#39;bob\u0026#39;) ..timeToBirth(60000)) .build(); var value = \u0026#39;+1 100 200 300\u0026#39;; var putResult = await atClient.put(phoneKey, value); Scan/List behavior with TTB\nA key whose ttb has been set will be listed.\nLookup/Get behavior with TTB\nUntil the key’s TTB is met, a “lookup” of the key returns ‘null’. After which the original value of the key is returned.\nTTR - Time to refresh\nTTR (Time To Refresh) is the span of time that represents the time interval at which the cached key will be refreshed with a new value(if the original key\u0026rsquo;s value is updated). TTR is expressed in seconds. Further, TTR can also be set to \u0026lsquo;-1\u0026rsquo; which represents the value of the original key will not be updated and therefore the cached key need not be refreshed.\nCacheability\nAll of the data created resides in the secondary server of an atSign. The owner of an atSign can choose to allow the public and the shared data to be cached in the another atSign\n// Below key refreshes everyday // TTR accepts time units in seconds var phoneKey = (AtKey.shared(\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, namespace: \u0026#39;wavi\u0026#39;) ..sharedWith(\u0026#39;bob\u0026#39;) ..cache(86400, true)) .build(); var value = \u0026#39;+1 100 200 300\u0026#39;; var putResult = await atClient.put(phoneKey, value); Scan/List behavior with TTR\nAll the keys with TTR and the cached keys that are created as a result of TTR are listed.\nLookup/Get behavior with TTR\nDuring lookup of a key, fetches for availability of the corresponding cached key. If a cached key is available, the value is returned. If cached is not available, fetches the value from the original key.\nUpdate behavior with TTR Only the owner of the key reserves the right to update the value. Updating the cached key’s value is prohibited.\nPropagation of an update to the cached key\nWhen an original key is updated by the creator, the ones who have cached it need to update the cached copy too. This can happen in two ways:\n The Auto-Notify notifies the updated value to another atSign, thereby the cached key’s value is updated. The refresh job in the secondary server  CCD - Cascade delete\nCCD (Cascade delete) compliments the TTR functionality by allowing the owner of the key to decide if the cached key has to be deleted upon the deletion of the original key. CCD accepts a boolean value(either true (or) false). When set to true, upon deletion of the original key, the cached key is also deleted. Setting it to false results in the cached key remaining, even after the original key is deleted.\n"
